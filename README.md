# Footnote Stylist

An add-on for Google Docs, written in Google Scripts, that allows footnotes to be styled in one go. The styling options are:

- Font Size
- Line spacing
- Alignment
- First line indent

Without this add-on, applying the above to every footnote requires the user to highlight and change one footnote at a time.

## Installation

Footnote Stylist is available free of charge in the Google Add-Ons store, which can be accessed from within a Google document by going to the "Add-ons" menu and selecting "Get add-ons...".

Once installed, Footnote Stylist will appear under the "Add-Ons" menu. Footnote Stylist provides two buttons: "Configure Styling" and "Refresh".

## Configure Styling

This button opens a dialog that allows the user to choose their styling options. They then have the further option of saving these as a user-wide default, or simply updating the current document. There is also the option to restore the users saved defaults.

## Refresh

Newly created footnotes will revert to the Google default style.Use the "refresh" button to bring the document in line with the styling chosen in Footnote Stylist.

## Font

Footnote Stylist does not interfere with the way Google Docs styles interact with footnotes. If the font of the Normal style is changed, these changes will be reflected in the footnotes. Docs' default font size is 10pt. If footnotes revert to this on changing the Normal style, simply refresh the document from the Footnote Sylist menu.
