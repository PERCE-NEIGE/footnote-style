Footnote style allows you to change the style of all of your Google Docs footnotes at once. It works like Docs' own styles.

## Setting the style

To set the footnote style you want, highlight an existing footnote or create one and style it in the way you want. Then, with the footnote still highlighted, go to 'Add-ons→Footnote Style→Update footnote style to match'. This will save your style settings and update all footnotes.

New footnotes will revert to Google Docs' default style. Simply use the 'Refresh footnotes' option to re-apply your style to the document.

>NOTE: Attributes like text alignment apply to paragraphs, not text within paragraphs. For these to be picked up by Footnote Style, you must select an entire paragraph (this can be done by triple clicking the paragraph.

## User defaults

You can save a default footnote style for use in future documents from the footnote style menu.
